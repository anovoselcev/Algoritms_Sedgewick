The book "Algorithms in C ++" introduces many new algorithms, and their explanations are much more detailed than in the previous edition. The new text structure and detailed illustrations to it, together with accompanying comments, significantly improve the presentation of the material. The third edition also contains a successful combination of theory and practice that makes Sedgwick's work an invaluable resource for over 300,000 programmers worldwide!

Parts 1â€“4 of the book cover fundamental algorithms, data structures, sorting, and searching. It provides a detailed description of the fundamental data structures and algorithms for sorting, searching, and related applications. While the material in this book is essentially applicable to programming in any language, the Van Wyck and Sedgwick implementations make use of the natural relationship between C ++ classes and abstract data type (ADT) implementations. Part 5 of the book examines graph algorithms, which play an increasingly important role in a variety of applications, such as network connectivity, circuit design, charting, transaction processing, and resource provisioning.

Each part contains new algorithms and implementations, improved descriptions and diagrams, and many new exercises for better understanding of the material. The emphasis on ADTs broadens the range of applications of programs and fits better with modern object-oriented programming environments.

The book "Algorithms in C ++" describes the following topics:
- Detailed description of arrays, linked lists, strings, trees and other basic data structures
- Emphasis on abstract data types (ADTs), modular programming, object-oriented programming, and C ++ classes
 - More than 100 algorithms for sorting, selection, priority queue ADT implementations and symbol table ADT implementations (for search)
 - New implementations of binomial queues, multipath radix sort, randomized BSTs, canted trees, puff lists, multipath trie trees, B-trees, extensible hashing, and many more
 - A larger amount of numerical characteristics of algorithms that allow you to compare them
 - Over 1000 new exercises to help you understand the properties of algorithms
 - A complete overview of graph properties and types
 - Digraphs and DAGs
 - Minimum spanning trees
 - Shortest paths
 - Network streams
 - Diagrams, C ++ code examples and detailed algorithms descriptions
 - The C ++ Algorithms book provides programmers with a complete toolkit for implementing, debugging, and using fundamental algorithms in a wide range of computer applications.
